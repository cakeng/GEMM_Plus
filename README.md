# mGEMM proof-of-concept implementation source code.

Source code of the proof-of-concept implementation used to test mGEMM algorithm - https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3498361.3538940

mGEMM is referred to as "PTMM" or "GEMM PLUS" in the code. These are just the development names of mGEMM.

This code compiles a library that provides a convolution function which implements mGEMM algorithm.

Please refer to https://github.com/cakeng/mGEMM_darknet_tests repo for detailed guide in using library in actual DNN execution.
